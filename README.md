Project Description
ReverseFit is a humorous fitness web app that flips your goals upside down. Instead of helping you reach your target weight, it calculates how far off you are—with sabotage logic, random diet plans, and emotionally confusing fitness tips. It’s fitness, but backwards.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People are too obsessed with progress. What about celebrating failure? There’s no app that tells you how badly you missed your goal and then gives you a certificate for it. We fixed that.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Flask app that takes your fitness goal and sabotages it. Whether you want to gain or lose weight, ReverseFit tells you how much you accidentally did the opposite. It then offers absurd diet plans, confusing fitness tips, and a motivational quote that may or may not help.
