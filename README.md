# 🏋️‍♂️ ReverseFit: The Fitness App That Does Everything Wrong (On Purpose)

Welcome to **ReverseFit**, the only fitness app that celebrates laziness, soda hydration, and deep-fried salad. Built with Flask and a sense of humor, ReverseFit helps you track your *reverse* progress and get *unfit* in style.

## 🚀 Features

- 🍦 **Reverse Diet Generator**  
  Enter your goal (e.g. "lose weight", "build muscle") and get the *worst* advice imaginable.

- 📉 **Reverse Progress Tracker**  
  Compare your current and previous weight. Gain weight? You're winning. Lose weight? Shame.

- 🎉 **Random Fitness Tips**  
  Like: “Running late counts as cardio.” Or “Stretch your excuses before your muscles.”

- 🧾 **Certificate of Unachievement** *(coming soon)*  
  Because you deserve recognition for doing absolutely nothing.
